  <h2>Distribution + Habitat</h2>
    <p>Brown bears were once native to much of Asia, some parts of the Atlas Mountains of Africa and perhaps most of Europe and North America,[143] but are now extinct in some areas and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas.[2][79] There are approximately 200,000 brown bears left in the world.</p>

  <h3>North America</h3>
 <details>
  <summary>Canada</summary>
    <p>As many as 20,000 brown bears range throughout the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, British Columbia and in the majority of Alberta. Canada has one of the most stable brown bear populations today.</p>

  <summary>United States</summary>
    <p>The brown bear has lost 98% of its habitat in the lower 48 states. About 95% of the brown bear population in the United States is in Alaska, though in the lower 48 states, they are repopulating gradually but steadily along the Rockies and the western Great Plains.[147][148] The Alaskan population is estimated at 32,000 individuals.[149] The largest populations of brown bears in the lower 48 states are found in the 23,300-km2 Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the 24,800-km2 Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem.</p>

   <h3>Europe</h3>
    <p>In Europe, there are 14,000 brown bears in ten fragmented populations. They are extinct in the British Isles, extremely threatened in France and Spain and in trouble over most of Central Europe.[9][79]</p>
    <p>Brown bears reach their western limits in Spain. In the Cantabrian Mountains of northwest Spain, some 210 bears were found to dwell in Asturias, Cantabria, Galicia and Le√≥n, in the Picos de Europa and adjacent areas in 2013.[159] As of 2015, this population was estimated at around 250 individuals, but only due to it being a more extensive survey and their numbers may be declining rather than increasing.</p>
