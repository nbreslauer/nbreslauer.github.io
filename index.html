   <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
       <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
The <strong>brown bear</strong> <i>(Ursus arctos)</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear">bear</a> that is found across much of northern Eurasia and North America.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> In North America the population of brown bears are often called grizzly bears. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the polar bear <i>(Ursus maritimus)</i>, which is much less variable in size and slightly larger on average.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref1">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>

The brown bear's principal range includes parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</a>, Central Asia, China, Canada, the United States, Scandinavia and the Carpathian region, especially Romania, Anatolia and the Caucasus.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></sup> <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries.

While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012, this and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN.[1][2][10] However, the California, North 
African and Mexican subspecies were hunted to extinction in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered.[1][7] One of the smaller-bodied subspecies, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts.[11] The Marsican brown bear, one 
of several currently isolated populations of the main Eurasian brown bear population in central Italy, is believed to have a population of just 30 to 40 bears.[9][12]
