  <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
  <div>  
   <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p> The <strong>brown bear</strong> <i>(Ursus arctos)</i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear">bear</a> that is found across much of northern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_AmericaNorth">America</a>.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> In North America the population of brown bears are often called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grizzly_bear">grizzly bears</a>. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)">order</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivora">Carnivora</a>, rivaled in size only by its closest relative, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_bear">polar bear</a> <i>(Ursus maritimus)</i>, which is much less variable in size and slightly larger on average.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref1">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> <sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> </p>
      <p> The brown bear's principal range includes parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</a>, <a                         href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia">Central Asia</a>, China, Canada, the United States, Scandinavia and the Carpathian region, especially Romania, Anatolia and the Caucasus.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></sup> <sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries. </p>
      <p> While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012, this and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN.[1][2][10] However, the California, North 
African and Mexican subspecies were hunted to extinction in the 19th and early 20th centuries and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered.[1][7] One of the smaller-bodied subspecies, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts.[11] The Marsican brown bear, one 
of several currently isolated populations of the main Eurasian brown bear population in central Italy, is believed to have a population of just 30 to 40 bears.[9][12] </p>

     <h3>Evolution and taxonomy</h3> 
      <p>The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the <i>bruin</i>, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English">Middle English</a>. This name originated in the fable, <i>History of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynard_the_Fox">Reynard the Fox</a></i>, translated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Caxton>William Caxton</a>, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Dutch">Middle Dutch</a> <i>bruun</i> or <i>bruyn</i>, meaning <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown">brown</a></i> (the color).[13] In the mid-19th century United States, the brown bear was termed "Old Ephraim" and sometimes as "Moccasin Joe".[14]</p>
      <p>The scientific name of the brown bear, <i>Ursus arctos</i>, comes from the Latin <i lang="la">"ursus"</i>, meaning "bear",[15] and <i lang="el">Άρκτος</i> "arctos", from the Greek word for bear.[16]</p>

     <h3>Generalized brown bear names and evolution</h3>
      <p>Brown bears are thought to have evolved from Ursus etruscus in Asia.[17][18] The brown bear, per Kurten (1976), has been stated as "clearly derived from the Asian population of Ursus savini about 800,000 years ago; spread into Europe, to the New World."[19] A genetic analysis indicated that the brown bear lineage diverged from the cave bear species complex approximately 1.2–1.4 million years ago, but did not clarify if U. savini persisted as a paraspecies for the brown bear before perishing.[20] The oldest fossils positively identified as from this species occur in China from about 0.5 million years ago.[17] Brown bears entered Europe about 250,000 years ago and North Africa shortly after.[17][21] Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the British Isles, where it is thought they might have outcompeted giant cave bears (Ursus spelaeus).[17] The species entered Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until 13,000 years ago.[17] It is speculated that brown bears were unable to migrate south until the extinction of the much larger giant short-faced bear (Arctodus simus).[22][23]</p>
      <p>Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: inland brown bears, also known as grizzlies, are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula.[17] Brown bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.[17] In North America, two types of the subspecies Ursus arctos horribilis are generally recognized—the coastal brown bear and the inland grizzly bear; these two types broadly define the range of sizes of all brown bear subspecies.[7]</p>

     <h3>Scientific brown bear taxonomy</h3>
      <p> There are many methods used by scientists to define bear species and subspecies as no one method is always effective. Brown bear taxonomy and subspecies classification has been described as "formidable and confusing" with few authorities listing the same specific set of subspecies.[24] Genetic testing is now perhaps the most important way to scientifically define brown bear relationships and names. Generally genetic testing uses the word clade rather than species because a genetic test alone cannot define a biological species. Most genetic studies report on how closely related the bears are (or their genetic distance). There are hundreds of obsolete brown bear subspecies, each with its own name, and this can become confusing; Hall (1981) lists 86 different types and even as many as 90 have been proposed.[25][26] However, recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five main clades which contain all extant brown bears,[27][28] while a 2017 phylogenetic study revealed nine clades, including one representing polar bears.[29] As of 2005, 15 extant or recently extinct subspecies were recognized by the general scientific community.[30][31] </p>
      <p>As well as the exact number of overall brown bear subspecies, its precise relationship to the polar bear also remains in debate. The polar bear is a recent offshoot of the brown bear. The point at which the polar bear diverged from the brown bear is unclear, with estimations based on genetics and fossils ranging from 400,000 to 70,000 years ago, but most recent analysis has indicated that the polar bear split somewhere between 250,000 and 130,000 years ago.[32] Under some definitions, the brown bear can be construed as the paraspecies for the polar bear.[33][34][35] DNA analysis recently revealed that the brown bears in North America are genetically quite homogeneous except for one subspecies - the Kodiak bear - and the enigmatic ABC Islands bears that have the mtDNA of the polar bear (Ursus maritimus).[36]</p>
      <p>The subspecies have been listed as follows:[30]</p>
